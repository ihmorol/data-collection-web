## 📏 When to Use Lite vs Full

| Scenario | Team |
|----------|------|
| Landing page, portfolio, simple tool | **Lite** (9 skills) |
| Small SaaS, dashboard, CRUD app | **Lite** (9 skills) |
| App with auth + payments | Full (27 skills) — needs `clerk-auth`, `stripe-integration` |
| Enterprise SaaS, multi-service | Full (27 skills) — needs architecture, security, CI/CD |

> **Upgrade path:** Start with Lite. When you need auth, payments, CI/CD, or advanced testing, switch to the full `webapp-team`.
